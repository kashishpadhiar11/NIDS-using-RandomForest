# NIDS-using-RandomForest

After data preprocessing and feature selection, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using cross-validation to ensure reliable evaluation. Ensemble classifiers like Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost are trained using optimized hyperparameters (via grid or random search) and consistently outperform individual models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Deep learning techniques such as CNNs and RNNs are also explored to capture complex traffic patterns and enhance detection performance.

Anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM complement traditional methods by identifying novel or zero-day attacks. Feature selection improves both model accuracy and efficiency by focusing on the most relevant attributes, while visualizations aid in understanding model behavior.

To ensure scalability and real-time response, the NIDS is designed with distributed computing and real-time data streaming capabilities. Rigorous testing, including stress and adversarial tests, confirms the systemâ€™s robustness. Continuous monitoring and optimization help the system adapt to evolving cybersecurity threats, making it a proactive and reliable solution for intrusion detection across dynamic environments.
